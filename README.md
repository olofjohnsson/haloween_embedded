# Description
This is the third generation of our Halloween expo, hosted in the basement. Visitors step into a pitch-dark space filled with eerie music to set the mood. Their mission is to hunt for spiders â€” but only one spider at a time reveals itself. Each spider has a small light that turns on in a predefined order, guiding visitors through the experience step by step. When a spider is found and its button is pressed, a frightening sound effect and a spooky light show are triggered.

This sequence repeats with each spider until the visitors reach a PIR sensor, which unleashes a ghost racing along a zip line, accompanied by terrifying noises. Finally, a guiding light leads them to a bucket of candy as their sweet reward for surviving the haunted adventure.
